## Composer bio
Matthew Slayton’s compositions reflect his fascination with biological and linguistic systems, where multiple lines and levels operate simultaneously. His work has been performed around the country, has been used in documentary films and video game scores, and was featured at the Sō Percussion Summer Institute in 2017. He graduated from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music where he studied with Elinor Armer, and previously studied with Marta Ptaszynska and Augusta Read Thomas at the University of Chicago and Anthony Kelley and Stephen Jaffe at Duke University.
